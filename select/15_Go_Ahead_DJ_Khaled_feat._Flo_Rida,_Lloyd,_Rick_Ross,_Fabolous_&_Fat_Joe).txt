Yeah I met this shorty last night right

And you know I see you with your man
She was like nah thats my friend
Oooh Okay
So that was my cue
Ayo Fab
Ey Khaled

Shorty wanna give me the go ahead
That I'ma stay even when i need to go head
And if I feel something I'ma try
Figured you winked at me not just something in your eye
See shawty you ain't got to tell me what I know
That was E40 who said tell me when to go
I know I got the green light
And ya'll get the red light
So if the head right I'll be there err night
Err night like a playoff game

Let it be house, yea the comfortable places
Married to the game on a prenuptial basis

We can do that, there, just gimme the go
Been a playa' unprepared, everybody grown folks
'Round here, them gold bottles hold them up
Then we can say, cheeers (Let's take a toast)
No wheat or white bread in my Pilsbury dough
Just give me the right head with the letters G-O
All eyes on you like your momma, lame as a video
Imagine you and other kitties, y'all are upon the city

I know you see me starin' girl
I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin' luck in the street

Crack! How hot is hot?
She on fire baby burn the block
I even taught her how to turn to pot
You cool it off, and it come back rock (crack!)
Yes! I am him
Pull strings like a violin
Then I cross over like I'm Iverson
To Z100 out to Ireland
White chicks is standin' on line
Black chicks is standin' on line
Don't discriminate, I disintegrate
So much cake, maybe we can get away

I know you see me starin' girl
I see you lookin' at me
Go find and it's apparent girl
You feelin' luck in the street
Girl tell me, what's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
What's on your mind, let me know
Girl give me the go, give me the go ahead
