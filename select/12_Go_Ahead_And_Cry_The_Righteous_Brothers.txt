Love can change a young boy into a man
But a broken heart can change a man
Back into a boy again

You're not the first man to cry
When things have gone wrong
You're only human
You're only so strong

It takes more
Than a tear to knock a big man down
It takes more
Broken heart to keep him down on the gound
It takes three little words
To make him stand again

So cry
Go ahead and cry
Cry

Love is so easy to play
But so hard to read
You're still a young man
Your heart will love again

It takes more
Little kiss from her sweet tender lips
It takes more
Gentle touch from her soft finger tips
It takes more than one tear
To mend a broken heart

So cry
Go ahead and cry
Cry

Go ahead and cry
Don't be ashamed to cry
Cry
